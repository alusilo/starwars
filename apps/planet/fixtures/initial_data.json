Before the Imperial uprising, Alderaan was represented in the waning days of the Republic by such venerated politicians as Bail Organa. In fact, Alderaan was one of the earliest supporters of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, though its officials prudently kept all ties to the Rebellion secret. Despite such discretion, the Empire knew it to be a haven of rebel activity, making it a target of reprisal as soon as the Death Star was operational."

            "description": "Tatooine is harsh desert world orbiting twin suns in the galaxy's Outer Rim. In the days of the Empire and the Republic, many settlers scratched out a living on moisture farms, while spaceport cities such as Mos Eisley and Mos Espa served as home base for smugglers, criminals, and other rogues. Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker both once called Tatooine home, although across the stars it was more widely known as a hive of scum and villainy ruled by the crime boss Jabba the Hutt."

Extending from the dense canopy are enormous mesas, atop which Hutt settlers and other shifty types build sanctuaries. A converted B'omarr monk castle that became a Hutt stronghold was the apparent headquarters of mysterious kidnappers who captured Jabba the Hutt's son during the Clone Wars. When the Republic launched a concerted effort to rescue the Huttlet, they found Separatist forces defending the otherwise abandoned fortress."
